# Ruby MUD Client

A web-based MUD client written in Ruby. This project allows you to interact with a MUD game through a terminal-like interface in the browser.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

### 2. Configure the Application

Copy the example configuration file and rename it to `config.rb`:

```bash
cp config.example.rb config.rb
```

Edit `config.rb` to configure the application as needed (e.g., server settings).

### 3. Run the Server

Start the application server:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

The application will now be running, and you can access it through your browser.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the MUD game through the terminal interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to send commands to the server and receive responses.
